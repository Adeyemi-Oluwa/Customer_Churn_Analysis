# Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Objective
I developed an interactive dashboard using PowerBI to identify churn drivers and trends from customer behavior and payment data, creating multiple visuals that gives insights into the dataset.
This process involves various stages like data importation, data preprocessing, data cleaning and overall data visualization on Churn drivers.
